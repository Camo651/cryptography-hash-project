1. Check amount of time taken to hash a list line by line rather than a whole document at once:
-> The format of the input file can be seen in 'rockyou_strong.txt' or 'test3.txt'
-> 'test3.txt' just contains the first 12 passwords of 'rockyou_strong.txt'
-> Any number of modified hash functions can be tested (at least one)
-> To run the program

    $ python3 metrics.py sha256.exe <file_name>

-> Ex:

   $ python3 metrics.py ../sha256.exe ../sha256_MDHK.exe rockyou_strong.txt
